I'm trying to use SBCL as a shared library inside an android app.
Current status: failure.

This is a minimalistic application for android that should work, but it doesn't.

Compilation:
To compile an apk you just need to call "./gradlew" script.
You should have some kind of java installed, but I have no idea what are the exact requirements.

Right now it will work ARM64. It should be easy to do the same thing at least for X86-64.
To use another CPU architecture:
1) change the target ABI in app/build.gradle and app/jni/Application.mk
2) compile sbcl as a shared library for android with required CPU architecture
  (see my fork of sbcl for example)
3) run your newly built sbcl from adb shell to create a core from the file "lisp/hello-alien.lisp"
4) copy libsbcl.so and alien.core to app/jni/sbcl/libsbcl.so and app/jni/core/libcore.so
5) run ./gradlew

The app will just freeze, unfortunately.

You can adjust the app to not use sbcl (to test that the problem is in it):
In the file app/jni/src/hello-alien.c comment out the second line (with definition of FAKE).

Then you should be able to see some kind of path on the screen.

You can compile an executable to be run from adb shell.
The precompiled executable is located in the app/jni/src folder (hello-alien).

To compile it yourself:
1) uncomment the first line in app/jni/src/hello-alien.c
2) compile it with NDK clang (from app/jni/src folder):
    $CC -o hello-alien hello-alien.c -lm -ldl -lsbcl -L../sbcl -Wl,--export-dynamic
3) push the result onto your device
    adb push hello-alien /data/local/tmp
4) push the core into the same folder (or copy it if you have compiled it yourself)
    adb push ../core/libcore.so /data/local/tmp/alien.core
5) push the shared library:
    adb push ../sbcl/libsbcl.so /data/local/tmp/libsbcl.so
6) Connect to adb shell and:
6.1) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the directory with libsbcl.so:
    adb shell
    cd /data/local/tmp
    cd export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)
6.2) and run the executable:
    ./hello-alien

It should print something like that:
Alien: Hello alien world :/
